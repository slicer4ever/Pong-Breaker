Pong-breaker is an Open source game, built on top of https://github.com/slicer4ever/Lightwave

This game was made for https://gamedev.net/ Pong Challenge! (https://www.gamedev.net/forums/topic/693219-november-2017-gamedev-challenge-pong/)

The goal of this is to be integrate emscripten (https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) with my framework and engine, making the game playable in the browser.  The game concept's twist mechanic well be around how the player's paddle is controlled, instead of the standard up/down behavior, each player well be given a number of blocks placable on their side, each block takes several hits to break.  Hopefully this game concept well be somewhat fun.  To stretch out the use of emscripten, we will be making the game fully networked with a fairly simple networking and matchmaking system.
